# Personal-google-search-analysis
This is my personal google search analysis over the years

It has two parts, one just the script and the other trying to convert the same into a shiny(R) app.

To run the app, you'll have to 
1) visit website--- 
https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1

2) select none (unless you want to download other data)
3) go to My Activity
4) Select specific activity data
5) Select Search
6) Next and download the Archive
7) Extract the Archive
8) Remember the location of the extracted archive

Then run app and upload the search archive file named (My Activity.html) (NOT index.html)
Enjoy the insights :)
